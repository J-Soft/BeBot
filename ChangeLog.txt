- Moved ConfigMagik out of main and into Source and converted it to use the singleton design pattern.

- Created a commodities directory for class files that do not instantiate themselves
- Fixed countless php warnings and notices meaning it should now be possible to run the bot with php E_ALL logging turned on to help ease debugging.

  socket timeout which is 60 seconds for most installs.

API Changes:
- Moved aochat event handling out of Main.php and in to AOChat.php
- Added third optional parameter $header (bol TRUE/FALSE) to make_blob displaying VhaBot like terminal header. Shamelessly borrowed from VhaBot. Defaults to TRUE
- Added fourth optional parameter $strip (bol TRUE/FALSE) to chatcmd to allow stripping of all formatting for the actual link. This allows custom formatting of links. Defaults to FALSE.
- Added sixth optional parameter $strip (bol TRUE/FALSE) to make_item to allow stripping of all formatting for the actual link. This allows custom formatting of links. Defaults to FALSE.

Removed Modules:

+Possible BREAKAGE! - Preliminary testing shows modules appear to be working as expected.
+- Moving from Status array to BotError. This WILL cause breakage until the checks have been converted as well.
+- Moving uid/uname cache from AOChat to core/PlayerList.php. Calls to core("chat")->get_u* are now deprecated and PlayerList does return BotError on failures.

- Added !whois command to IRC channel.
- Catching one more possible empty select return in AlienAttack_GUILD.
- Disconnecting from IRC on a clean shutdown of the bot.
- Renamed Relay_GUILD to just Relay as it now contains settings useful for the relaybot (which will typically be a raid style bot rather than an org bot).  Added options to spam autoinvites to bots every 5 minutes to insure that they stay part of the relay.  Two new settings are now included for the relay bot (if spamming autoinvites is enabled, and what security group to use for the autoinvites). Relay now defaults to off.

- Renamed Bio.php to Identify.php.  Added in the Alappaa Galactic gems.  Module can now parse multiple items posted to it, and new items can be easily added.
- Closed rather large hole in the roster update that allowed members who were no longer part of the organization (or did not even exist) to remain part of the bots users and (possibly) on the bots buddylist.  core/Roster.php now loops through all users in the database to validate some basic information.  This only effects org bots, raid bots functionality is unchanged.
- Added option in Bot.conf to select what to display for the timestamp on each message in the console (datetime, date, time, or none).
- Resetting org info of not updated org members in whois-update.php. The updated timestamp is reduced to increase the chance of them getting updated on next whois lookup.

- Updated core/Roster.php to capture the results of roster updates to the database.
- Fixed wrong case of ID index in whois module.
- Created wrapper for get_uid and get_uname.  Bot.php now attempts to look up the uid or name from the Funcom server.  If that fails, it will attempt to get the information from the whois table.
- Ported Raid.php to trunk.  Raid now no longer references the (non-existant) points table.  All extraneous commands have been removed.  Raid module should function appropriately now.

- Modified AOChat to be more graceful on EOF errors (will now die() when socket is no longer a resource instead of constantly spamming errors).
- Removed IRC.Announce setting, it's no longer needed.
- Added setting to toggle where IRC joins and parts should be announced too (if at all).

------------------------
Release 0.3.4 - Jun 2007
------------------------
Important:
===============================================================================
- Important note for module developers
  Due to character id's now being 2^31 in size and how the bot deals with this, you must remember to use the int_to_string and string_to_int whenever
  you want to work with the "real" character id's. Internally the bot will happily churn on using overflowed integers that goes negative.
  Remember also to convert any "real" character id's back to an overflowed integer before passing something back to the bot to handle internally.
  Database entries will be stored with the overflowed integer value, NOT the "real" character id's.
  
- This version adds tablename prefix support:
  - Add new configuration entries to MySQL.conf
  - You MUST manually alter the tablenames before starting this version or start with an empty database.
    Alternatively you can set the prefix to be blank.
  - ALL MySQL queries must be updated in custom modules to make use of table prefixes.
    Table names should now be referenced as: #___name where #___ will automatically be replaced with
    the correct prefix by the bot during runtime.
- Bot.php, MySQL.php and AOCHAT.php have been moved into the subdirectory Sources.
  Please take care to remove the old files in the root directory after upgrading if installing to
  the same directory.
- main.php has been renamed Main.php.
- start.php has been renamed StartBot.php.
- start.bat has been renamed StartDebugBot.bat.
- StartBot.bat has been added and will allow the bot to automatically reconnect if disconnected or crashed.
- Rooster_GUILD.php and Rooster_RAID.php have been renamed to Roster.php and is now a core module.
  Be sure to disable/remove the old Rooster_* modules.
- _Colors.php renamed to Colors.inc, _TeamsClass.php renamed to Teams.inc.
- The function $this -> bot -> get_site has been completely rewritten
  with inspiration by ShadowGod's AOXML class and php.net comments:
  - The likelyhood of get_site causing the bot to hang should be eliminated completely now.
    The timeout has been reduced to 20 seconds total and can be overridden using additional parameters.

-------------------------
Release 0.2.10 - Nov 2006
-------------------------
===============================================================================
- Important note for module developers
  Due to character id's now being 2^31 in size and how the bot deals with this, you must remember to use the int_to_string and string_to_int whenever   you want to work with the "real" character id's. Internally the bot will happily churn on using overflowed integers that goes negative.
  Remember also to convert any "real" character id's back to an overflowed integer before passing something back to the bot to handle internally.
  Database entries will be stored with the overflowed integer value, NOT the "real" character id's.
===============================================================================
- Backported buddylist caching from 0.3 to eliminate logoff spam during first roster update
  aswell as when chatserver is having issues.
  The bot will still spam logons when this happens however.

  the central items database server was unreachable.
