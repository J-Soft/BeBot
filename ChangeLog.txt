- Moved ConfigMagik out of main and into Source and converted it to use the singleton design pattern.
- Moved the configuration reading from Main.php and into Bot.php
- Added debugging function toggled by a bot variable.
- Changed most Commands to SuperAdmin instead of Owner as Superadmin should be almost as good as owner but isn't owner.
- Moved the server list into it's own file and changed the way game and server is detected. Dimension 0-3 are no longer valid and are replaced by Testlive, Atlantean, Rimor and Die neue welt. No backwards compatibility implimented
- Added level command to IRC (coded by nyt), Prefix no longer Required for /msg botname in IRC, /msg botname now Output error if unknown command.
- Created a commodities directory for class files that do not instantiate themselves
- Fixed countless php warnings and notices meaning it should now be possible to run the bot with php E_ALL logging turned on to help ease debugging.

- Bot now includes bot name and dimension in user agent on HTTP requests.
- !roll should work properly now.
- Improved !raffle logic slightly. Will now determine the number of times to do a roll depending on the number of people in the raffle.

- Added a Link for turning LFT on in click to join blob, can be disabled under settings.
- Autoinvites users who apear to have LD during a Raid.
- rally's can now be saved and loaded
- The bot will now automatically use cURL if it is available. The previous get_site setting has been removed
  and a new setting added to allow disabling cURL.
- The socket method used for get_site should now properly time out instead of waiting for the default
  socket timeout which is 60 seconds for most installs.
- Removed a bug where cron jobs sometimes didn't execute right on time.
- Added Tank and Caller Info to Raid Spam.

API Changes:
- Moved aochat event handling out of Main.php and in to AOChat.php
- Added third optional parameter $header (bol TRUE/FALSE) to make_blob displaying VhaBot like terminal header. Shamelessly borrowed from VhaBot. Defaults to TRUE
- Added fourth optional parameter $strip (bol TRUE/FALSE) to chatcmd to allow stripping of all formatting for the actual link. This allows custom formatting of links. Defaults to FALSE.
- Added sixth optional parameter $strip (bol TRUE/FALSE) to make_item to allow stripping of all formatting for the actual link. This allows custom formatting of links. Defaults to FALSE.
- chatcmd() now allows / as $origin parameter and will not prefix the chatcmd in any way.
- Added this->bot->core("tools")->my_rand($min=false, $max=false) wrapper to call random number generator.
- Removed one optional parameter from get_site leaving the parameters now as: url, $strip_headers = FALSE, $read_timeout = FALSE.
  Only $url is a required parameter.
- AOChat now utilizes the Symfony Event Dispatcher for it's events.

New Modules:
- Added AdminsUI Module to allow members to easily see the admin list, which also shows alts and status

+Possible BREAKAGE! - Peliminary testing shows modules appear to be working as expected.
+- Moving from Status array to BotError. This WILL cause breakage until the checks have been converted aswell.
+- Moving uid/uname cache from AOChat to core/PlayerList.php. Calls to core("chat")->get_u* are now depricated and PlayerList does return BotError on failures.
+- rosterupdate seems to output alot of errors todo with failed to get whois (confirmed by luyu)
 
+Known breakage
+- IRC module fails to process commands given in IRC.
