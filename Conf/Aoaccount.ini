	Set it below ONLY in case it's DIFFERENT than ingame chat log stored in bot's conf file ; otherwise leave it empty string (as 2x double quotes : "") as it was by default
	To do it PROPERLY : first COPY this file, then RENAME it using Ao Account name (keep the .ini extension, e.g. : myaccname.ini), and finally EDIT it below as explained upper
	In case of several accounts, as for bot proxy, repeat upper steps for whole network accounts.
