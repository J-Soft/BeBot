Once you passed North, a short stair will bring you up to a Scourge that will, once dead, pop a portal to next islands.

After few more mobs and a bridge, you will encounter The Night Hearth. You will have to stand at its feets all along, and kill surroundings mobs, pinks ahead.

Its loot tables is in same upper link. It is mainly high level symbiants of all profiles (support, extermination, infantry, artillery) and some weapon upgrade items.

Once dead, another stair will lead to another Scourge also popping a portal for next islands.

Few more mobs and a huge Scourge later, you will zone to Beast platform.

Jumped to its laird, Beast awaits you. He got few tricks : mob popping, nuking, warping, reflecting, NCU resetting, etc.

If you survive him, you may now have access to its weapons, stars & armors, among which the rare and seeked Burden of Competence.

The loot table is also in upper link. A portal is available to come back to Rubi-Ka within City of Home Pyramid beside NCP Number 9.

<font color='#ff9933'>Few more things</font></end>

If you want to make sure people will get their Codes for the Beast quest, you may want to roll a playfield ahead of raid time.
Team up with 2 toons, make one enter and use walls to jump close to Middle node Zod.
If it's not a Libra, you can disband team and repeat (team up again, enter new zone, check Middle).
When you endly get a Libra, keep 1 toon inside and invite all the raid in the team.

Also in some cases, your team may want to blitz faster upto TNH and Beast, gaining 3 Zod kill time.
That is usefull if you specifically need only to farm TNH symbiants and/or Beast armor, e.g.
For that, all raid must wisely use walls to avoid mobs and stack on the ramp near North node Zod (but not too close).
Once ready, rush kill this one for safety and you can do the rest of raid normally (but West, East and Middle will stay alive, so avoid them).
